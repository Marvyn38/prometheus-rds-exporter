# prometheus-rds-exporter
Prometheus exporter for Windows Server RDS metrics

A basic exporter to get the number of sessions per RDS "Session Host" and their state.

Needs to be started from the connection broker / Manager to work.

I may add other metrics later on (such as list of users, license server status, ...)
